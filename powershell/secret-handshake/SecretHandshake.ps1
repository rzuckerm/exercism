    .SYNOPSIS
    Convert a number between 1 and 31 to a sequence of actions in the secret handshake.

    .DESCRIPTION

    Start at the right-most digit and move left.

    The actions for each number place are:
    00001 = wink
    00010 = double blink
    00100 = close your eyes
    01000 = jump
    10000 = Reverse the order of the operations in the secret handshake.
    
    .PARAMETER Number
    The value to be converted into a sequence of actions.

    .EXAMPLE
    Invoke-SecretHandshake -Number 2
    Returns: @("double blink")
     #>
    [CmdletBinding()]
    Param(
        [int]$Number
    )
    (($Number -band 0x10) ? @(3..0) : @(0..3)).Where({ $Number -band (1 -shl $_) }) | ForEach-Object { $Global:actions[$_] }
}
